      <h4>Components of the web
      </h4> you, computer running a web browser, the internet, and servers. 
      HTML docs are heart of web made up of text content, markup what it looks like, references to images and videos, links to other pages. 
      html markup made up of tags. 
      em tag em for emphasis anchor tag a tag a href href is attribute a href="google">derp 
      <br>
      images alt="text"> alt is text displayed when image isnt there  imges dont have closing tags just void tag means no content
      to make html have space use br tag break also a void 
      this text is long two br tags make it two lines,
      another way doing line breaks is p tag paragraph 
      <p> content, this is a paragraph 
      </p>
      br tag is called inline and p tag block 
      <b>p
      </b> tag makes 
      <b>invisible box
      </b> instead of blank line invisible box can have 
      <br>height and width. 
      Two more elemenes span and div difference span is inline div is block 
      attach styles to them 
      <span class="foo">
      </span> chaging span to div makes same behavior as paragraph and puts invisible box 
      focus on content in body
